## Introduction
CLASS will use the shipping containers themselves as a control-room on site. To accomplish this we will have the shipping containers modified by a specialty company. The included [sketch](https://github.com/gothed/portfolio/blob/master/container/container.svg) shows how I suggest one of the containers should be outfitted to allow for a comfortable control-room.

## Computing Infrastructure
This layout allows for two full size Rack-Mount-Units. Labeled RMU0 and RMU1 in the  [schematic](https://github.com/gothed/portfolio/blob/master/container/container.svg). These RMU's can slide forward so that the back may be accessible. A dense wall can be used to dampen the sound of the servers. This wall will also be ideally suited to post schematics of the computing infrastructure and network infrastructure. This will be of great benefit when service is necessary.

## The Operators
The control room includes one fifteen foot long table designed for use by three operators. Five operators could easily fit, however, for long term work; three would be much more comfortable. Since the width of the container (eight feet) is too narrow to allow for two, two foot tables on either wall, I suggest that the utility of the limited space is maximized by installing one three foot deep table. The opposite wall can support a one foot deep shelving unit. Since there is only a single working surface for operators we should try to maximize this area while simultaneously minding the operator's ergonomics. To this effect I suggest that all monitors be mounted on swiveling arms attached to the wall. A keyboard tray should be installed below the table. Not only have we maximized ergonomics in a limited space, however, this configuration also allows for a total of 45 square feet of working area to be used as the operators see fit.

## Screens
There is currently a plan to have a total of five screens at the operators table, one workstation, and one laptop. The five screens should be 24 inch IPS displays. Four of which will be connected to the display computer in the first RMU. These first four screens will display real time information of the experiment. The fifth screen will be connected to its own computer (I suggest a NUC), and it will display an advanced terminal. This is the terminal from which all commands will be issued. Finally, there should be a dedicated computer for operators to engage in inappropriate behavior (Facebook, YouTube...). Finally there will likely be a spare laptop which can also be used to trouble shoot systems on the mount, when troubleshooting from the control-room fails.


## Final Touches
Finally, two decent quality speakers should be suspended from the ceiling so that operators may listen to triumphant classical music, preferable in D-Major, while discovering B-Modes.
