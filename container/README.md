## Introduction
CLASS will use the shipping containers themselves as a control-room on site. To accomplish this we will have the shipping containers modified by a specialty company. The included [sketch](https://github.com/gothed/portfolio/blob/master/container/container.svg) shows how I suggest one of the containers should be outfitted to allow for a comfortable control-room.

## Server Room
A seperate server room allows for seperate environmental conditionaing for the operators and the servers. Additionally, it provides much better noise isolation from the servers. This room will contain the necessary computing infrastructure for CLASS. It will also contain the desktops systems for the operators. To that extend each operator will have the following routed to their workstation.

### Operator One (The Visualizer)
1. Four miniDP sockets. (For four displays connected to the visualization computer.)
2. Four USB 3.0 A sockets. (One each for mouse and keyboard and two spare.)
3. Six standard power sockets. (Four for the screens and two spare.)
4. Two RJ45 ethernet sockets. (Both RJ45 are spare.)

### Operator Two (The Controller)
1. Two miniDP sockets. (One for the display and one spare.)
2. Four USB 3.0 A sockets. (See Operator One.)
3. Four standard power sockets. (One for the screen and three spare.)
4. Two RJ45 ethernet sockets. (Both RJ45 are spare.)

### Operator Three (The Klaun)
1. Two miniDP sockets. (To allow the possibility of having a remote work station, but otherwise spare.)
2. Four USB 3.0 A sockets. (See #1.)
3. Four standard power sockets. (One for the laptop, three spare. Dependent on #1.)
4. Two RJ45 ethernet sockets. (One for the laptop, the other spare.)

<## Computing Infrastructure
This layout allows for two full size Rack-Mount-Units. Labeled RMU0 and RMU1 in the  [schematic](https://github.com/gothed/portfolio/blob/master/container/container.svg). These RMU's can slide forward so that the back may be accessible. A dense wall can be used to dampen the sound of the servers. This wall will also be ideally suited to post schematics of the computing infrastructure and network infrastructure. This will be of great benefit when service is necessary.>

## The Operators
The control room includes one fifteen foot long table designed for use by three operators. Five operators could easily fit, however, for long term work; three would be much more comfortable. Since the width of the container (eight feet) is too narrow to allow for two, two foot tables on either wall, I suggest that the utility of the limited space is maximized by installing one three foot deep table. The opposite wall can support a one foot deep shelving unit. Since there is only a single working surface for operators we should try to maximize this area while simultaneously minding the operator's ergonomics. To this effect I suggest that all monitors be mounted on swiveling arms attached to the wall. A keyboard tray should be installed below the table. Not only have we maximized ergonomics in a limited space, however, this configuration also allows for a total of 45 square feet of working area to be used as the operators see fit.

## Screens
There is currently a plan to have a total of five screens at the operators table, one workstation, and one laptop. The five screens should be 24 inch IPS displays. Four of which will be connected to the display computer in the first RMU. These first four screens will display real time information of the experiment. The fifth screen will be connected to its own computer (I suggest a NUC), and it will display an advanced terminal. This is the terminal from which all commands will be issued. Finally, there should be a dedicated computer for operators to engage in inappropriate behavior (Facebook, YouTube...). Finally there will likely be a spare laptop which can also be used to trouble shoot systems on the mount, when troubleshooting from the control-room fails.

## Windows
Two large (six feet wide) windows are built into the control room to allow operators clear view of the telescope. The window faces the telescop and the Operator workstation faces away from the telescope. This, seemingly counter-intuitive decision was made due to the large number of screens the operators need access to. These screens would block view of the telescope in any meaningful way.

## Inside Container Width
There are some concerns that the eight feet width is not enough. Specifically the finished wall material takes up another seven inches (according to John K). Due to revision B no longer having storage in the control-room (this has been moved to the, now dedicated, server-room), I belive there is enough space for the operators even if we loose a total of one foot due to finishing the interior. That leaves four feet between the wall and the desk. In my opinion this is plenty for operators to be comfortable. I belive that trading additional space for poorer thermal insulation will result in decreased comfort for the operators.

## Final Touches
Finally, two decent quality speakers should be suspended from the ceiling so that operators may listen to triumphant classical music, preferable in D-Major, while discovering B-Modes.
