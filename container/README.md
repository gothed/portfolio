Giving each operator five feet of personal space, horizontally, this control center acomodates three operators. It is also very feasable to have up to five
operators simultaneous working at this table. I choose a three foot deep table as the eight foot width of the container did not allow for meaningful placement
of two parrallel tables. A single table with maximum depth would maximize working area under these constrains. Furthermore, I suggest that the monitors be
on wall mounted swing arms as to further free working space on the table. The keyboards should be on trains underneath the table. This configuration allows
the operator the spread schematics and other work on an un-restricted working surface of 45 square feet. The shelving on the back wall should not be much
deeper than one foot so as to allow enough room for operators to recline and pass by each other without interference.The RMUs should be seperated by a
heavy wall so as to dampen the whirring noise of servers that has driven many men mad. This seperating wall should be used to pin up shematics of the
network and instructions on how to replace components. The Shelving should have replacement components well organized and immidiatly accesible. Finally
we should install two decent quality speakers and playback triumphent classical music, preferably in D major.
